    |     **** NOTE THIS ADD-ON ****
    | The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for software libraries
    | in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to be valid for this artwork
    | library too.
    | Primary iconset is a special kind of software library, it is an
    | artwork library, its elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
    | GUI.
    | Source code, for this library means:
    |  - for vectors svg;
    |  - for pixels, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
    | otherwise png.
    | The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
    | notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
    | With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
    | containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
    | The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
    | the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
